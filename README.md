# doItAgain

In the everyday life, everyone of us does a lot of things simultaneously. We live very dynamic and having free time to hang around and do nothing is mostly missing.

So, after finishing the regular work for today, there are still couple of things that are waiting for us to get done before the day is over. 

If you're like me, you would like to keep track on things that you did in the past and you would like to do them again in near time.
BUT, do you know how many days has passed, since the last time you went out with your friends for a beer?
Or, when was the last time you did breakfast for your wife? 

I really don't like to start searching for these events in my calendar to find out when they happened, somethimes we just don't even
write everything down, we notice such things in our mind instead.

This is what this app is for. To keep track on small but very important details that you care of. 

This app doesn't require any permissions of any system settings or other apps. The data is stored locally on your phone - so you could use this app in offline mode as well. 

HOW THIS APP WORKS: 

Add/Insert an activitiy that you did to your list and provide the date when you did it for the very last time. The counter will automatically determine how many days has passed till today.

Swipe right on an item to see the reset icon if you want to restart the counter when you do the same activity again.

Swipe left on an item to see the reminder icon, by clicking it you'll choose the number of days when you would like to get reminded to do this activity again. 

Deleting or sharing an activity with your friends is also possible by performing a long click on an activity item.

You can use this app either in light or dark mode. 

Enjoy!
