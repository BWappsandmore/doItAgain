# doItAgain

In the everyday life, if you do a lot of things simultaneously, you'll soon become a multitasking talent.
Your life becomes very dynamic, the free time to hang around and do nothing flushes away.
So, after finishing your work for today, there are still couple of events that are waiting for you to attend. 

If you're like me, you would like to keep track on things you did in the past that you would like to do them again soon.
BUT, do you know how many days has passed, since the last time you went out with your friends for a beer?
Or, when was the last time you did breakfast for your wife? 

I really don't like to start searching for these events in my calender to find out when they happened, somethimes you just don't even
write everything down, you just notice such things in your head - just like me :).

This is what this app is for. To keep track on small but very important details that you care of. 
I really want to do this app as simple as possible: without any dependencies of any other apps like calender integration or something. 

HOW THIS APP WORKS: 

Add an activitiy that you did to your list and provide the date when you did it for the very last time. The counter will automatically
determine the days until today. If you do this activity again, you are free to reset the counter.
