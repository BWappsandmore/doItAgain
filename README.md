# doItAgain

In the everyday life, if you do a lot of things simultaneously, you'll soon become a multitasking talent.
Your life becomes very dynamic, the free time to hang around and do nothing flushes away.
So, after finishing your work for today, there are still couple of things that are waiting for you to be done. 

If you're like me, you would like to keep track on things that you did in the past and you would like to do them again in near time.
BUT, do you know how many days has passed, since the last time you went out with your friends for a beer?
Or, when was the last time you did breakfast for your wife? 

I really don't like to start searching for these events in my calender to find out when they happened, somethimes you just don't even
write everything down, you just notice such things in your head.

This is what this app is for. To keep track on small but very important details that you care of. 
I really wanted to build this app as simple as possible: there are no permissions of other apps necessary and the data is stored on your phone only - so you could use this app in offline mode as well. 

HOW THIS APP WORKS: 

Add/Insert an activitiy that you did to your list and provide the date when you did it for the very last time. The counter will automatically determine how many days has passed till today.
Reset the counter when you do the same activity again. You can get reminded to do an activity again by setting a reminder too. 
Deleting an activity is also possible by performing a long click on a activity.
You can use this app either in light or dark mode too. 

Enjoy!
